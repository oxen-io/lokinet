/**
 * "Trampoline" class that listens for UDP DNS packets when we have exit mode enabled.  These arrive
 * on localhost:1053 coming from lokinet's embedded libunbound (when exit mode is enabled), wraps
 * them via NetworkExtension's crappy UDP API, then sends responses back to libunbound to be
 * parsed/etc.  This class knows nothing about DNS, it is basically just a UDP packet forwarder, but
 * using Apple magic reinvented wheel wrappers that are oh so wonderful like everything Apple.
 *
 * So for a lokinet configuration of "upstream=1.1.1.1", when exit mode is OFF:
 * - DNS requests go unbound either to 127.0.0.1:53 directly (system extension) or bounced through
 *   TUNNELIP:53 (app extension), which forwards them (directly) to the upstream DNS server(s).
 * With exit mode ON:
 * - DNS requests go to unbound, as above, and unbound forwards them to 127.0.0.1:1053, which
 *   encapsulates them in Apple's god awful crap, then (on a response) sends them back to
 *   libunbound to be delivered back to the requestor.
 * (This assumes a non-lokinet DNS; .loki and .snode get handled before either of these).
